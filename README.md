• Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas and Matplotlib on a large dataset, consisting of 30,000 
customers with 24 attributes.

• Pre-processed with feature-encoding, scaling, and transformations using NumPy, and Scikit-learn and applied
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the features to 16 preserving 95% of explained variance.

• Built a prediction model using Support Vector Machines (SVM), implemented from scratch in Python, which 
efficiently predicted credit card defaults with 78% accuracy.

• Improved the performance of the model to 82% accuracy with a Feed-forward Neural Network built using Keras
and TensorFlow and optimizing the parameters with hyper-parameter tuning
